# Node.js Overview

[![nodejs](nodejs.png)](https://nodejs.org/en/)

Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, back-end JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside
a web browser. Node.js lets developers use JavaScript to write command line tools and for server-side scriptingâ€”running
scripts server-side to produce dynamic web page content before the page is sent to the user's web browser.

## Key Features of Node.js {collapsible="true" default-state="expanded"}

### JavaScript Everywhere

- Enables developers to use JavaScript for server-side scripting, promoting code reusability and ease of development.

### Asynchronous and Event-Driven

- All APIs of Node.js library are asynchronous (non-blocking). It means a Node.js-based server never waits for an API to
  return data, which enhances performance.

### Single-Threaded but Highly Scalable

- Uses non-blocking, event-driven architecture, making it lightweight and efficient for data-intensive real-time
  applications that run across distributed devices.

### NPM (Node Package Manager)

- Comes with a huge library of npm modules to simplify your development process.

## Usage of Node.js {collapsible="true" default-state="expanded"}

- Building scalable network applications.
- Real-time applications like chat and gaming apps.
- Data streaming applications.
- Server-side web applications.
- API development.

## Popular Node.js Frameworks {collapsible="true" default-state="expanded"}

### Express.js

- Minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile
  applications.

### Socket.io

- Enables real-time bidirectional event-based communication. It's perfect for building chat applications.

### Meteor

- A full-stack platform that comes with an extensive collection of packages and features for building modern web and
  mobile applications.

## Advantages of Node.js {collapsible="true" default-state="expanded"}

- **Fast Processing**: Node.js is built on the Google V8 JavaScript engine which compiles JavaScript directly to native
  machine code for fast execution.
- **Unified JavaScript Development Stack**: Using JavaScript on both frontend and backend increases efficiency and
  reduces development time.
- **Large Community and Ecosystem**: Extensive open-source libraries available through npm.

## Conclusion {collapsible="true" default-state="expanded"}

Node.js has revolutionized how developers think about and build web applications, especially for scenarios requiring
real-time data or high scalability. Its non-blocking, event-driven architecture makes it a robust platform for web
application development.
