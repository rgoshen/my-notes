# Cloud Computing Overview

Cloud computing is the delivery of different services through the Internet, including data storage, servers, databases,
networking, and software. It offers faster innovation, flexible resources, and economies of scale.

## What is Cloud Computing? {collapsible="true" default-state="expanded"}

Cloud computing is a model for enabling ubiquitous access to shared pools of configurable system resources and
higher-level services that can be rapidly provisioned with minimal management effort, often over the Internet.

## Key Characteristics of Cloud Computing {collapsible="true" default-state="expanded"}

- **On-Demand Self-Service**: Users can provision resources as needed without requiring human interaction with each
  service provider.
- **Broad Network Access**: Services are available over the network and accessed through standard mechanisms.
- **Resource Pooling**: The provider's computing resources are pooled to serve multiple consumers.
- **Rapid Elasticity**: Capabilities can be elastically provisioned and released to scale rapidly outward and inward.
- **Measured Service**: Cloud systems automatically control and optimize resource use by leveraging a metering
  capability.

## Service Models of Cloud Computing {collapsible="true" default-state="expanded"}

### Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)

- Provides basic computing infrastructure: servers, storage, and networking resources.
- **Examples**: AWS EC2, Google Compute Engine, Microsoft Azure.

### Platform as a Service (PaaS)

- Offers an environment for developing, testing, and managing software applications.
- **Examples**: Heroku, Google App Engine, AWS Elastic Beanstalk.

### Software as a Service (SaaS)

- Delivers software applications over the Internet, on-demand, and typically on a subscription basis.
- **Examples**: Google Workspace, Microsoft Office 365, Salesforce.

## Deployment Models {collapsible="true" default-state="expanded"}

- **Public Cloud**: Services are delivered over the public Internet and shared across organizations.
- **Private Cloud**: The cloud infrastructure is dedicated to a single organization.
- **Hybrid Cloud**: Combines public and private clouds, bound together by technology that allows data and applications
  to be shared.

## Benefits of Cloud Computing {collapsible="true" default-state="expanded"}

- **Cost Efficiency**: Reduces the cost of managing and maintaining IT systems.
- **Scalability**: Offers the ability to scale up or down as needed.
- **Performance**: Regularly updated to the latest generation of fast and efficient computing hardware.
- **Security**: Many cloud providers offer a set of policies, technologies, and controls that strengthen your security
  posture.

## Challenges and Considerations {collapsible="true" default-state="expanded"}

- **Data Privacy and Security**: Understanding the security measures the cloud provider has in place.
- **Compliance**: Ensuring that the cloud services are compliant with relevant laws and regulations.
- **Service Reliability and Downtime**: Selecting reliable service providers and planning for possible downtime.

## Conclusion {collapsible="true" default-state="expanded"}

Cloud computing has fundamentally changed the landscape of technology and business, offering scalable, efficient, and
economic solutions for a variety of computing needs. Its adoption continues to grow as organizations seek to leverage
the benefits of cloud technology.
