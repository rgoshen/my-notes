# Web Development Overview

You've been using the internet your entire life - chances are you've never really sat down and thought about the
mechanics behind how it works. Well, it's not magic, but it's not rocket science either. The internet is built upon a
foundation of agreed-upon protocols, the ones we'll be looking at handle data transmission. We'll go over some of the
most important principles like HTTP, GET vs. POST, DNS, and the Request/Response Cycle.

This unit will explore how the internet works and the various protocols that enable browsers to send and receive data.
We'll walk you through how searching for a URL returns a fully functional web page. This new knowledge is guaranteed to
impress strangers at parties, but more importantly, most phone technical phone screens will quiz you on how stuff like
the DNS works. Your ability to land an in-person interview will be directly tied to your ability to explain the concepts
in this unit to a recruiter, concisely. You'll also learn about AJAX and how to write asynchronous code - which will
enable you to write code that continues to execute while waiting to receive the response for a fetch request.

Web development is a vast field that involves building and maintaining websites. It's divided into frontend and backend
development, each focusing on different aspects of creating a website or web application.

## Frontend Development {collapsible="true" default-state="expanded"}

Frontend development is the practice of producing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for a website or Web Application so that a
user can see and interact with them directly.

- **HTML (HyperText Markup Language)**: The standard markup language for creating web pages.
- **CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)**: Used for styling and layout of web pages.
- **JavaScript**: A programming language that allows you to create dynamically updating content, control multimedia,
  animate images, and much more.

### Popular Frontend Frameworks and Libraries

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Angular**: A platform for building mobile and desktop web applications.
- **Vue.js**: A progressive framework for building UIs.

## Backend Development {collapsible="true" default-state="expanded"}

Backend development is the server-side of web development, focusing on database interactions, user authentication,
server, network, and hosting configuration.

- **Languages**: Python, Ruby, PHP, Java, .NET, JavaScript (Node.js)
- **Databases**: MySQL, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, SQLite
- **Frameworks**: Express (Node.js), Django (Python), Ruby on Rails (Ruby), Laravel (PHP)

### Backend Concepts

- **Server Management**: Understanding of how web servers operate.
- **Database Management**: Storing, retrieving, and updating data in a database.
- **API (Application Programming Interface)**: Allows different software to communicate with one another.

## Tools and Practices {collapsible="true" default-state="expanded"}

- **Version Control (Git/GitHub)**: Essential for tracking changes to the codebase and collaborating with others.
- **Responsive Design**: Techniques to make web design look good on all devices.
- **Testing and Debugging**: Ensuring the website is free of errors and functions as intended.

## DevOps and Deployment {collapsible="true" default-state="expanded"}

- **Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD)**: Automating the deployment process.
- **Containerization (Docker)**: Deploying applications in a portable and consistent environment.
- **Cloud Services (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud)**: Hosting applications on cloud platforms.

## Conclusion {collapsible="true" default-state="expanded"}

Web development is a dynamic and continually evolving field, requiring a blend of technical skills, creativity, and an
understanding of the latest technologies and trends.

This overview encapsulates the key aspects of front-end development, offering insights into the technologies, tools, and
practices essential for modern web developers.
