# DevOps Overview

DevOps is a set of practices that combines software development (Dev), and IT operations (Ops), aiming to shorten the
development lifecycle and provide continuous delivery with high software quality.

## What is DevOps? {collapsible="true" default-state="expanded"}

DevOps is an approach to culture, automation, and platform design intended to deliver increased business value and
responsiveness through rapid, high-quality service delivery.

## Key Principles of DevOps {collapsible="true" default-state="expanded"}

- **Collaboration**: Breaking down silos between development and operations teams to enhance communication and
  collaboration.
- **Automation**: Automating repetitive tasks to increase efficiency and reduce the likelihood of human error.
- **Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**: Integrating code changes frequently and ensuring that
  changes pass automated tests. Automatically deploying code to production environments.
- **Monitoring and Feedback**: Continuously monitoring applications and infrastructure performance to quickly respond to
  issues.

## Important DevOps Practices {collapsible="true" default-state="expanded"}

- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Managing and provisioning infrastructure through code instead of through manual
  processes.
- **Microservices Architecture**: Designing applications as a collection of loosely coupled services.
- **Continuous Testing**: Implementing automated testing in the development process to ensure software quality.

## Popular DevOps Tools {collapsible="true" default-state="expanded"}

- **Jenkins**: An open-source automation server that enables developers to build, test, and deploy their software.
- **Docker**: A platform for developing, shipping, and running applications in isolated environments called containers.
- **Kubernetes**: An open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized
  applications.
- **Ansible**: An open-source tool for software provisioning, configuration management, and application deployment.

## Benefits of DevOps {collapsible="true" default-state="expanded"}

- **Faster Deployment**: Accelerates time to market for new features and fixes.
- **Improved Collaboration**: Enhances team efficiency and innovation.
- **Greater Scalability**: Facilitates efficient management of infrastructure and environments.
- **Reduced Risk**: Through automated, consistent delivery approaches.
