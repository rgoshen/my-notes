# Computational Thinking for Problem-Solving

**incomplete**

## Course Description {collapsible="true" default-state="expanded"}

Computational thinking is the process of approaching a problem in a systematic manner and creating and expressing a
solution such that it can be carried out by a computer. But you don't need to be a computer scientist to think like a
computer scientist. In fact, we encourage students from any field of study to take this course! Many quantitative and
data-centric problems can be solved using computational thinking and an
understanding of computational thinking will give you a foundation for solving problems that have real-world, social
impact.

In this course, you will learn about the pillars of computational thinking, how computer scientists develop and analyze
algorithms, and how solutions can be realized on a computer using the Python programming language. By the end of the
course, you will be able to develop an algorithm and express it to the computer by writing a simple Python program.

This course will introduce you to people from diverse professions who use
computational thinking to solve problems. You will engage with a unique community of analytical thinkers and be
encouraged to consider how you can make a positive social impact through computational thinking.
