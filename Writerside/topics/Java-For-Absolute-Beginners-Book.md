Other languages compile source code directly into machine code designed to run on a specific microprocessor architecture
or OS (i.e., such as windows)

JVM mimics a Java processor that interprets the program into a sequence of actions or OS calls on any processor
regardless of OS

Basics Steps in Java:

1. Developer writes program.java (source file)
2. Java compiles source file to program.class (byte code)
3. JVM executes the byte code on OS (interprets)
