# HTML (HyperText Markup Language) Overview

HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is the standard markup language used to create web pages. It forms the structure of
web pages and is the foundation of all websites.

## What is HTML?

- **Foundation of Web Pages**: HTML provides the basic structure of sites, which is enhanced and modified by other
  technologies like CSS and JavaScript.
- **Markup Language**: It uses tags and attributes to define the structure and layout of a web document.

## Basic Structure

An HTML document has a specific structure that includes doctype, head, and body sections:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Page Title</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1>This is a Heading</h1>
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

## Key Elements

- **Tags**: HTML uses "tags" to mark up the start and end of an element, like `<p>` for a paragraph.
- **Attributes**: Provide additional information about elements. For example, `src` in an `<img>` tag to specify the
  image
  source.
- **Elements**: The combination of a start tag, content, and an end tag (e.g., `<p>Content here</p>`).

## Commonly Used HTML Elements

- **Headings**: `<h1>` to `<h6>` tags for defining headings.
- **Paragraph**: `<p>` tag for text.
- **Links**: `<a>` tag for hyperlinks.
- **Images**: `<img>` tag for embedding images.
- **Lists**: `<ul>` for unordered lists, `<ol>` for ordered lists, and `<li>` for list items.
- **Tables**: `<table>`, `<tr>`, `<th>`, and `<td>` for creating tables.
- **Forms**: `<form>`, `<input>`, `<textarea>`, `<button>` for creating interactive forms.

## HTML5

- **Latest Standard**: HTML5 is the latest version, providing new features for modern web development.
- **New Semantic Elements**: Such as `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<article>`, and `<section>` for better document structure.
- **Multimedia Support**: Tags like `<video>` and `<audio>` to embed video and audio content directly.

## Accessibility

- **Important for Inclusivity**: Proper use of HTML is crucial for making websites accessible to all users.
- **Semantic HTML**: Using the correct tags and attributes enhances the accessibility of web documents.
