## Key Concepts of React {collapsible="true" default-state="expanded"}

### Components

- React is all about components â€“ reusable pieces of your UI.
- Components can be nested, managed, and reused to build complex UIs.

### JSX

- JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that looks similar to HTML.
- It allows you to write HTML structures in the same file as your JavaScript code.

### Virtual DOM

- React uses a virtual DOM to improve performance.
- It only updates parts of the page that have changed, not the entire page.

### Props and State

- Props are how you pass data from parent to child components.
- State is a way to maintain data that changes over time in your components.
