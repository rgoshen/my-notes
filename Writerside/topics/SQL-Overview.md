# SQL Overview

SQL databases, also known as relational databases, use Structured Query Language (SQL) for defining and manipulating
data. They are crucial in a wide range of applications for data storage and retrieval.

## What is a SQL Database? {collapsible="true" default-state="expanded"}

A SQL database is a type of database that uses SQL to interact with data. It organizes data into one or more tables
where data types may be related to each other; these relations help structure the data.

## Key Features of SQL Databases {collapsible="true" default-state="expanded"}

- **Structured Data**: Data is stored in tables, making organization and retrieval efficient.
- **Data Integrity**: Ensures accuracy and consistency of data through constraints.
- **Complex Queries**: Powerful querying capabilities for complex data retrieval and analysis.
- **ACID Compliance**: Adherence to Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability properties for reliable transactions.
- **Scalability**: Capable of handling large volumes of data.

## Popular SQL Database Systems {collapsible="true" default-state="expanded"}

### MySQL

- Widely used open-source SQL database.
- Known for its reliability, simplicity, and popularity in web applications.

### PostgreSQL

- Advanced open-source SQL database.
- Offers features like complex queries, foreign keys, triggers, views, transactional integrity, multiversion concurrency
  control.

### Microsoft SQL Server

- A comprehensive database server and information platform offering a complete set of enterprise-ready technologies and
  tools.

### Oracle Database

- A multi-model database management system known for its scalability, reliability, and extensive feature set.

## Use Cases of SQL Databases {collapsible="true" default-state="expanded"}

- **Web Applications**: For storing user data, posts, comments, and more.
- **E-commerce Sites**: To manage product inventory, customer data, and order transactions.
- **Enterprise Applications**: For handling complex business data and processes.

## SQL Language Basics {collapsible="true" default-state="expanded"}

- **DDL (Data Definition Language)**: Defines the structure of the database. Commands include `CREATE`, `DROP`, `ALTER`.
- **DML (Data Manipulation Language)**: For data manipulation. Commands include `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`.
- **DCL (Data Control Language)**: Controls access to data. Commands include `GRANT`, `REVOKE`.

## Challenges in SQL Databases {collapsible="true" default-state="expanded"}

- **Schema Rigidity**: Changing the database schema can be complex and time-consuming.
- **Scaling**: Vertical scaling is often necessary, which can be expensive.

## Conclusion {collapsible="true" default-state="expanded"}

SQL databases are a cornerstone of modern data management, offering powerful tools for storing, querying, and
manipulating structured data. Their wide range of applications and robust feature set make them a fundamental technology
in numerous industries.
