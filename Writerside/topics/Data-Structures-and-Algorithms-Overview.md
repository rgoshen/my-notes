# Data Structures and Algorithms Overview

Data structures and algorithms are core components of computer science. They are crucial for efficient problem-solving
and creating optimized software applications.

## What are Data Structures? {collapsible="true" default-state="expanded"}

Data structures are ways of organizing and storing data in a computer so that it can be accessed and modified
efficiently. They are critical for managing and processing data effectively.

### Common Data Structures

- **Arrays**: Collections of elements, identifiable by their index or key.
- **Linked Lists**: Consists of nodes that hold data and a reference (or link) to the next node in the sequence.
- **Stacks**: Follows Last In First Out (LIFO) principle.
- **Queues**: Follows First In First Out (FIFO) principle.
- **Trees**: Hierarchical data structures, with a root node and child nodes forming a tree-like structure.
- **Graphs**: Consists of a finite set of vertices (or nodes) and a set of edges connecting them.
- **Hash Tables**: Implements an associative array, a structure that can map keys to values.

## What are Algorithms? {collapsible="true" default-state="expanded"}

Algorithms are step-by-step procedures or formulas for solving a problem. They are fundamental to the development of
efficient and effective software.

### Types of Algorithms

- **Sorting Algorithms**: Such as Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort.
- **Search Algorithms**: Such as Linear Search, Binary Search.
- **Graph Algorithms**: Like Depth-First Search (DFS), Breadth-First Search (BFS), Dijkstra's Algorithm.
- **Dynamic Programming**: Method for solving complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems.

- **Resource Management**: Efficient use of resources like memory and processing power.

## Learning Data Structures and Algorithms {collapsible="true" default-state="expanded"}

- **Understanding Basics**: Start with basic data structures and simple algorithms, then progress to more complex ones.
- **Practice Coding**: Implement data structures and algorithms in a preferred programming language.
- **Problem-Solving**: Engage in competitive programming and problem-solving on platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, and
  Codeforces.
