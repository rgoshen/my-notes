# Java Language Overview

## Introduction {collapsible="true" default-state="expanded"}

Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language designed to have as few implementation
dependencies as possible. It is a general-purpose programming language intended to let application developers write
once, run anywhere (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need
for recompilation.

## Features {collapsible="true" default-state="expanded"}

- **Object-Oriented**: Java is purely object-oriented, which means that everything is an object that contains data and
  behavior.
- **Platform Independent**: Java code is compiled into bytecode, which can be run on any device equipped with a Java
  Virtual Machine (JVM).
- **Simple and Secure**: Java is designed to be easy to use and is secure, preventing many common programming errors by
  design.
- **Multi-threaded**: Java supports multi-threaded programming, allowing you to write programs that can perform many
  tasks
  simultaneously in a smooth and interactive manner.
- **Robust and Reliable**: Java places a lot of emphasis on early checking for possible errors, as Java compilers are
  able to detect many problems that would first show up during execution time in other languages.

## Core Components {collapsible="true" default-state="expanded"}

- **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: The JDK is a software development environment used for developing Java applications.
  It includes the Java Runtime Environment (JRE), an interpreter/loader (Java), a compiler (javac), an archiver (jar), a
  documentation generator (Javadoc) and other tools needed in Java development.
- **Java Virtual Machine (JVM)**: The JVM is an engine that provides a runtime environment to drive the Java Code or
  applications. It converts Java bytecode into machine language.
- **Java Runtime Environment (JRE)**: The JRE provides the libraries, the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), and other
  components to run applications written in Java.

## Hello World Example {collapsible="true" default-state="expanded"}

```java
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```

## Conclusion {collapsible="true" default-state="expanded"}

Java is a versatile, efficient, and widely used programming language with a strong community, comprehensive libraries,
and a vast ecosystem. It is suitable for all types of programming, from web applications to mobile applications and
large systems development.
