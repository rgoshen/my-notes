## Introduction to Python Programming Language {collapsible="true" default-state="expanded"}

Python is a high-level, versatile programming language acclaimed for its readability and straightforward syntax. Ideal
for beginners and powerful enough for seasoned programmers, Python is widely used in diverse fields.

### What is Python?

- **High-Level Language**: Python abstracts many details of the computer's operation, focusing on readability and
  simplicity.
- **Interpreted Language**: Python code is executed line by line, making debugging easier and suitable for rapid
  prototyping.
- **Dynamically Typed**: Python does not require explicit declaration of variables before using them.

### Why Choose Python?

#### Readability and Simplicity

- Python emphasizes readability, which makes the code easier to understand and maintain.
- Its syntax is simple and concise, often requiring fewer lines of code than other languages.

#### Versatility

- Python is used in web development, data science, artificial intelligence, scientific computing, and automation.
- It's a general-purpose language, suitable for a wide range of applications.

#### Large Community and Libraries

- Python has a robust and active community, offering extensive support and resources.
- A vast array of libraries and frameworks are available, enhancing Python's functionality in various domains.

### Getting Started with Python

#### Installation

- Python can be installed from the official website: [python.org](https://www.python.org/).
- It comes with a built-in IDE (Integrated Development Environment) called IDLE.

#### Writing Your First Python Program

```python
# This is a simple Python script

print("Hello, World!")
```

- This script uses the `print` function to output "Hello, World!" â€“ a traditional way to start learning a new
  programming language.

### Key Python Concepts

- **Variables**: Store data values.
- **Data Types**: Include integers, floats, strings, lists, tuples, and dictionaries.
- **Control Structures**: if statements, for and while loops.
- **Functions**: Blocks of reusable code.
- **Classes/Objects**: Python is an Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) language.

### Python Resources

- **Official Documentation**: Comprehensive guide to Python's features and libraries.
- **Online Tutorials and Courses**: Websites like Codecademy, Coursera, and Udemy offer Python programming courses.
- **Community Forums**: Platforms like Stack Overflow provide a place to discuss and solve programming issues.

## Misc {collapsible="true" default-state="expanded"}

### Create a virtual environment

```bash
python -m venv venv    # create
source venv/bin/activate    # linux/macos
source venv/scripts/activate    # windows
pip freeze > requirements.txt    # create
pip install -r requirements.txt # install
deactivate    # stop
```

if you do not want to use `venv`, you can do this:

```bash
python -m venv /path/to_folder/<env_name>
source /path/to_folder/<env_name>/bin[source]/activate
```

### Setup [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) for a project

- Steps to install [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv)
- [commands](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv/blob/master/COMMANDS.md)

```bash
pyenv install --list    # see which are available
pyenv install <version>
pyenv global <version>    # to change the global version
cd <project-folder>
pyenv local <python-version>    # change the local version
python --version    # check version
python -m venv <env-name>
source venv/bin/activate    # for macos and Linux
source venv\scripts\activate    # for windows
venv\scripts\activate        # for powersehll
```
