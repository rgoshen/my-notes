# Testing

Software testing is a critical process in software development that involves evaluating software to ensure it meets
specified requirements and is free of defects. It is integral to the quality assurance of software products.

## Purpose of Software Testing {collapsible="true" default-state="expanded"}

- **Identify Defects**: Discovering bugs and issues before the software becomes available to users.
- **Verify Requirements**: Ensuring the software meets the business and technical requirements that guided its design
  and development.
- **Ensure Quality**: Guaranteeing the software product is reliable, efficient, and user-friendly.

## Types of Software Testing {collapsible="true" default-state="expanded"}

### Functional Testing

- **Purpose**: To verify that each function of the software operates in accordance with the requirement specification.
- **Types**: Unit Testing, Integration Testing, System Testing, Acceptance Testing.

### Non-Functional Testing

- **Purpose**: To check non-functional aspects (performance, usability, reliability, etc) of a software application.
- **Types**: Performance Testing, Usability Testing, Security Testing, Compatibility Testing.

## Testing Methods {collapsible="true" default-state="expanded"}

### Manual Testing

- Test cases are executed manually (by a human) without any support from tools or scripts.

### Automated Testing

- Test cases are executed with the assistance of tools, scripts, and software.

## Levels of Software Testing {collapsible="true" default-state="expanded"}

1. **Unit Testing**
    - Tests individual units or components of the software.
2. **Integration Testing**
    - Combines individual units and tests them as a group.
3. **System Testing**
    - Tests a completely integrated system to verify it meets the specified requirements.
4. **End-to-End Testing**
    - Simulates real user scenarios to ensure the complete flow of the application works as expected, from start to
      finish. This includes testing the application in an environment that mimics the production environment.
5. **Acceptance Testing**
    - Checks if the system is ready for release and meets user needs.

## Test Planning and Design {collapsible="true" default-state="expanded"}

- Involves defining the scope and objectives of testing, selecting test cases, and identifying necessary resources.

## Bug Reporting and Tracking {collapsible="true" default-state="expanded"}

- A crucial part of the testing process, involving the documentation of found bugs and tracking their resolution.

## Conclusion {collapsible="true" default-state="expanded"}

Software testing is an essential aspect of software development, ensuring the reliability, security, and performance of
the final product. It encompasses a range of testing types and methods, each serving a specific purpose in the software
quality assurance process.
