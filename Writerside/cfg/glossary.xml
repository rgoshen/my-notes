    <term name="fqn">In Java, a fully qualified name refers to the complete path of a class or interface, which includes
        the package name followed by the class or interface name. This naming convention is used to uniquely identify a
        class or interface in situations where there might be multiple classes or interfaces with the same name in
        different packages. The fully qualified name helps to avoid naming conflicts by specifying the exact location of
        the class or interface in the package hierarchy.
